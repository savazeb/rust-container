# A Docker Container for Rust
Ready to use container template for rust development.

I make this rust container repo to learn the basic of rust programming language. Installing all the necessary files to build an environment for rust could be mess and harmful. By using rust official image the job could be done more easier and less harmful for the environment i'm using now.

[Rust official docker documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust?tab=description) is used as reference to build this container.

## Usage
For building, running and starting the container shell use the command bellow.

```
./run.sh
```
